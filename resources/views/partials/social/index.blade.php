            <h2>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
            <p> We innovate to reduce our environmental impact, conserve natural resources and energy, and operate in a
                sustainable and cost-effective manner.
                We are committed to advancing the communities in which we live and work, and we dedicate substantial
                energy, talent and resources to meaningful causes and initiatives that reflect our values and vision. We
                have a responsibility to make a difference and to help our communities succeed. And we bring the same
                energy and discipline to this pursuit as we do to our service to clients. To fulfill our mission, we
                provide pro bono services to eligible start-ups and also those who cannot afford our professional
                services; we support charitable and law-related organizations; we embrace and promote diversity within
                SMPV.
