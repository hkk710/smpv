This act provides the provisions regarding the protection of Wildlife.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s world is full of new technologies, machinery, buildings, offices. We are moving ahead with modernization but we are lacking behind with nature. Nobody is focusing on the environment, as due to deforestation and modernization, there is an imbalance in the environment. In order to preserve the world, we need to focus on the flora and fauna of the world. With the loss of the forests to deforestation, there has been an immense loss of the natural habitat of the wildlife. Many of the species are already extinct and many of them are going to be extinct. Hunting and eating of wild animals has also led to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it is very much necessary to understand the need of the hour and protect the wildlife. In order to protect them, many steps can be taken by the government as well as by the people. People should stop using the things which are made up of wild animal body parts which would help to reduce the demand for illegal wildlife animal parts and due to which hunting of animals will also be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sanctuaries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many wildlife sanctuaries all over the world. It is the natural habitat owned by the government or some private agency for the safeguard of the wild animals. They aim at providing a comfortable life for the animals. The importance of wildlife sanctuaries are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>To protect the endangered species.</li>\r\n	<li>It is difficult to relocate them from their natural habitat, so it is easy to protect them in their natural environment.</li>\r\n	<li>In sanctuaries, the endangered species are specially monitored. They grow and reproduce in numbers and provide protection.</li>\r\n	<li>Biologists and researchers are there who keep an eye on the animals.</li>\r\n	<li>These sanctuaries protect the species from humans and predators.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>National Park</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A national park is a park which is used for protection purposes. It protects places of natural beauty. The national park provides a safe home to the natural beauty and protects the animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Declaration of National Parks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/363486/\" target=\"_blank\">Section 35</a>&nbsp;deals with the declaration of national parks. It says:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>An area which by reason is ecological, has fauna, flora or with other benefits related to the wildlife needs to be constituted as a national park. To protect the wildlife, it may be constituted by the notification.</li>\r\n	<li>If any area is intended to be declared as a national park it is first applied to investigation of the land and determination of the claims.</li>\r\n	<li>No one can enter except the person who brings livestock for the animal.</li>\r\n	<li>The state government has all the rights of lands to be included in the national parks. State government should issue a notification specifying the limits of the area which is within the national park.</li>\r\n	<li>Only on the recommendation of the national board, the changes to the boundaries of national parks can be made.</li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, '2021-12-14 08:29:40', '2021-12-15 12:01:54', NULL);

After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2&nbsp; rapidly disseminated across the world in a short span of time, compelling the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since being declared a global pandemic, COVID-19 has ravaged many countries worldwide and has overwhelmed many healthcare systems. The pandemic has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy. Even though substantial progress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the management of COVID-19, limiting the continuing spread of this virus and its variants has become an issue of increasing concern, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to wreak havoc across the world, with many countries enduring a second or third wave of outbreaks of this viral illness attributed mainly due to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2, while adapting to their new human hosts, is prone to genetic evolution with the development of mutations over time, resulting in mutant variants that may have different characteristics than its ancestral strains. Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few are considered variants of concern (VOCs) by the WHO, given their impact on global public health. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, as of June 22, 2021, four SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Alpha (B.1.1.7):&nbsp;</strong>first variant of concern described in the United Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Beta (B.1.351)</strong>: first reported in South Africa in December 2020</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Gamma(P.1)</strong>: first reported in Brazil in early January 2021</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Delta (B.1.617.2):</strong>&nbsp;first reported in India in December 2020</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the unprecedented speed of vaccine development against the prevention of COVID-19 and robust global mass vaccination efforts, the emergence of these new SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to overturn the significant progress made so far in limiting the spread of this viral illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This review article aims to comprehensively describe the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and the latest novel therapeutics in the management of COVID-19. This review also briefly provides an overview of the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of different available vaccines for prevention against COVID-19 and its variants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Etiology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-stranded RNA(+ssRNA) viruses with a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope (<em>coronam</em>&nbsp;is the Latin term for crown) due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope. The subfamily&nbsp;<em>Orthocoronavirinae</em>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>Coronaviridae</em>&nbsp;family (order&nbsp;<em>Nidovirales</em>) classifies into four genera of CoVs:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Alphacoronavirus</strong>&nbsp;(alphaCoV)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Betacoronavirus</strong>&nbsp;(betaCoV)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Deltacoronavirus</strong>&nbsp;(deltaCoV)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Gammacoronavirus</strong>&nbsp;(gammaCoV)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>BetaCoV genus is further divided into five sub-genera or lineages.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Genomic characterization has shown that bats and rodents are the probable gene sources of alphaCoVs and betaCoVs. On the contrary, avian species seem to represent the gene sources of deltaCoVs and gammaCoVs. CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. Members of this large family of viruses can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in different animal species, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) capable of infecting humans have been identified. Some of the HCoVs were identified in the mid-1960s, while others were only detected in the new millennium. In general, estimates suggest that 2% of the population are healthy carriers of a CoVs and that these viruses are responsible for about 5% to 10% of acute respiratory infections.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Common human CoVs</strong>: HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 (betaCoVs of the A lineage); HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 (alphaCoVs). These viruses can cause common colds and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent individuals. However, in immunocompromised subjects and the elderly, lower respiratory tract infections can occur due to these viruses.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Other human CoVs</strong>: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (betaCoVs of the B and C lineage, respectively). These viruses are considered to be more virulent and capable of causing epidemics manifesting with respiratory and extra-respiratory manifestations of variable clinical severity.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>SARS-CoV-2&nbsp;is a novel betaCoV belonging to the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have been previously implicated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics with mortality rates up to 10% and 35%, respectively.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[3]</a>&nbsp;It has a round or elliptic and often pleomorphic form and a diameter of approximately 60&ndash;140 nm. Like other CoVs, it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. In this regard, although high temperature decreases the replication of any species of virus. Currently, the inactivation temperature of SARS-CoV-2 is being researched. A&nbsp;stainless steel surface held at an air temperature of 54.5&deg;C (130 &deg;F) results in the inactivation of 90% of SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 36 minutes. At 54.5&deg;C, the time for a 90% decrease in infectivity was 35.4 &plusmn; 9.0 min and the virus half-life was 10.8 &plusmn; 3.0 min.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[4]</a>&nbsp;Conversely, it may resist lower temperatures even below 0&deg;C. Also, these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents, including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform except for chlorhexidine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genomic characterization of the new HCoV, isolated from a cluster-patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan, had 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. Hence, it was termed SARS-CoV-2 by experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The single-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains 29891 nucleotides, encoding for 9860 amino acids.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, it is widely postulated to have originated from an animal implicating zoonotic transmission. Genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats. The genomic comparison between the human SARS-CoV-2 sequence and known animal coronaviruses indeed revealed high homology (96%) between the SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoV RaTG13 of bats (<em>Rhinolophus affinis</em>)<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[5]</a>Similar to SARS and MERS, it has been hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 advanced from bats to intermediate hosts such as pangolins and minks, and then to humans.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[6]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[7]</a>&nbsp;A recently released report by the WHO describing the possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive as it did not clearly specify the origin of the virus; however, it did report that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 occurred as early as December 2019. This report explored several possible hypotheses of the origin of the virus that included the origin of the virus in an animal, the transmission of the virus to an intermediate host, and subsequent passage into humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 Variants</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to genetic evolution resulting in multiple variants that may have different characteristics compared to its ancestral strains. Periodic genomic sequencing of viral samples is of fundamental importance, especially in a global pandemic setting, as it helps detect any new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the genetic evolution was minimal initially with the emergence of the globally dominant D614G variant, which was associated with increased transmissibility but without the ability to cause severe illness.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[8]</a>&nbsp;Another variant was identified in humans, attributed to transmission from infected farmed mink in Denmark, which was not associated with increased transmissibility<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[7]</a>. Since then, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been described, of which a few are considered&nbsp;<strong>variants of concern (VOCs)</strong>&nbsp;due to their potential to cause enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralization by antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination, the ability to evade detection, or a decrease in therapeutics or vaccination effectiveness. With the continued emergence of multiple variants, the CDC and the WHO have independently established a classification system for distinguishing the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 into variants of concern(VOCs) and&nbsp;<strong>variants of interest(VOIs)</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Alpha (B.1.1.7 lineage)</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>\r\n		<p>In late December 2020, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern,&nbsp;<strong>B.1.1.7 lineage</strong>, also referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Alpha variant&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>GRY</strong>(formerly&nbsp;GR/501Y.V1), was reported in the UK based on whole-genome sequencing of samples from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[9]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[10]</a></p>\r\n		</li>\r\n		<li>\r\n		<p>In addition to being detected by genomic sequencing,&nbsp;<strong>the B.1.1.7&nbsp;</strong>variant<strong>&nbsp;</strong>was identified in a frequently used commercial assay characterized by the absence of the S gene (S-gene target failure, SGTF) PCR samples. The B.1.1.7 variant includes 17 mutations in the viral genome. Of these, eight mutations (&Delta;69-70 deletion, &Delta;144 deletion, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) are in the spike (S) protein.

In the past two decades, several epidemics caused by viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 have been described which have had a significant impact on global health. Since being declared a global pandemic by the WHO, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 has spread to 223 countries with more than 178 million confirmed cases, and more than 3.8 million deaths reported globally. The U.S. experienced the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 related deaths followed by Brazil and India. In fact, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020 after heart disease and cancer, with approximately 375,000 death reported.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[29]</a>&nbsp;As of 22 June 2021, the Alpha(B.1.1.7) variant has spread to 170 countries, the&nbsp;Beta (B.1.351) variant has been reported in 119 countries, the Gamma (P.1) variant has been detected in 71 countries and the Delta variant(B.1.617.2)&nbsp;has spread to 85 countries around the world based on the weekly epidemiological update by the WHO. The WHO&rsquo;s current estimate of the global case fatality rate for COVID-19 is 2.2%. However, the case fatality rate is affected by factors that include&nbsp;age, underlying preexisting conditions, and severity of illness and significantly varies between countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Age, Gender-based Differences And The Impact Of Medical Comorbidities in COVID-19&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals of all ages are at risk of contracting this infection and severe disease. However, patients aged &ge;60 years and patients with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients)&nbsp;have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the CDC during January 22 to May 30, 2020. Notably, the study also reported that the percentage of patients who succumbed to this illness was 12 times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (19.5% vs. 1.6%).<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[30]</a>&nbsp;Data regarding the gender-based differences in COVID-19 suggests that male patients are at risk of developing severe illness and increased mortality due to COVID-19 compared to female patients.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[31]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[32]</a>&nbsp;Results from a retrospective cohort study from March 1 to November 21, 2020, evaluating the mortality rate in 209 US acute care hospitals that included 42 604 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported a higher mortality rate in male patients (12.5%) compared to female patients (9.6%).<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[33]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The severity of infection and mortality related to COVID-19 also varies between different ethnic groups.[30] Racial and ethnic minority groups were reported to have a higher percentage of COVID-19 related hospitalizations than White patients based on a recent CDC analysis of hospitalizations from a large administrative database that included approximately 300,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from March 2020 to December 2020. This high percentage of COVID-19 related hospitalizations among racial and ethnic groups was driven by a higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and an increased risk for developing severe COVID-19 disease.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[34]</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The results of a meta-analysis of 50 studies from the US and UK researchers noted that people of Black, Hispanic, and Asian ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 infection.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[35]</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>COVID-19 related death rates were the highest among Hispanic persons.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[29]</a>&nbsp;Another analysis by the CDC evaluating the risk of COVID-19 among sexual minority adults reported that underlying medical comorbidities which increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 were more prevalent in sexual minority individuals than heterosexual individuals both within the general population and within specific racial/ethnic groups.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[36]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">Go to:</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pathophysiology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The general description of viral structure and its genome of CoVs is essential for addressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. As described earlier, CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid, and the genomic structure is organized in a +ssRNA of approximately 30 kb in length and with a 5&prime;-cap structure and 3&prime;-poly-A tail making it the largest among RNA viruses. Upon entry into the host, replication of the viral RNA is initiated with the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab). The transcription occurs through the replication-transcription complex (RCT) organized in double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Conversely, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between the so-called open reading frames (ORFs) that work as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs. In an atypical CoV genome, at least six ORFs can be present. Among these, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), as well as one or two papain-like proteases for producing 16 with known or predicted RNA synthesis and modification functions non-structural proteins (NSPs 1-16). Besides ORF1a and ORF1b, other ORFs encode structural proteins, including spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains.[3]. Different CoVs possess unique structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sgRNAs.The pathogenesis of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is related to the function of the NSPs and structural proteins. For example, researchers have outlined the role of NSPs in blocking the host&#39;s innate immune response.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[2]</a>&nbsp;Among functions of structural proteins, the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release. Among the structural elements of CoVs, there are the spike glycoproteins composed of two subunits (S1 and S2). Homotrimers of S proteins compose the spikes on the viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors<strong>.</strong><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[37]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Structurally and phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is composed of four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) protein, along with 16 nonstructural proteins, and 5-8 accessory proteins.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[38]</a>&nbsp;The surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which resembles a crown, is located on the outer surface of the virion and undergoes cleavage into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit, which facilitates the incorporation of the virus into the host cell and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit containing a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain is responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[39]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[40]</a>&nbsp;The S1 subunit is further divided into a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), which facilitates viral entry into the host cell and serves as a potential target for neutralization in response to antisera or vaccines<strong>.</strong><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[37]</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The RBD is a fundamental peptide domain in the pathogenesis of infection as it represents a binding site for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system(RAAS), as previously hypothesized, does not increase the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and severe disease.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[41]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the hosts&#39; cells by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike or S protein (S1) to the ACE2 receptors abundantly on respiratory epithelium such as type II alveolar epithelial cells. Besides the respiratory epithelium, ACE2 receptors are also expressed by other organs such as the upper esophagus, enterocytes from the ileum, myocardial cells, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and urothelial cells of the bladder.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[42]</a>&nbsp;The viral attachment process is followed by priming the spike protein S2 subunit by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that facilitates cell entry and subsequent viral replication endocytosis with the assembly of virions.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[43]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, the spike RBD allows the binding to the ACE2 receptor in the lungs and other tissues. The spike protein of an amino acid site (polybasic site) allows the functional processing of the same by the human enzyme furin (protease). This process enables the exposure of the fusion sequences and, therefore, the fusion of the viral and cell membranes, a necessary passage for the virus to enter the cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Respiratory System/</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced Pneumonia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>COVID-19 is primarily considered a viral respiratory and vascular illness as its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, predominantly targets the respiratory and vascular systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is best explained by two stages, an early and a late phase. The early phase is characterized by viral replication resulting in direct virus-mediated tissue damage, which is followed by a late phase when the infected host cells trigger an immune response with the recruitment of T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophil recruitment which releases cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF &alpha;), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), ), IL-1&beta;, IL-8, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-&gamma;. In severe COVID-19, the immune system&#39;s overactivation results in a &#39;cytokine storm&#39; characterized by the release of high levels of cytokines, especially IL-6 and TNF-&alpha;, into the circulation, causing a local and systemic inflammatory response.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[44]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[45]</a>&nbsp;The increased vascular permeability and subsequent development of pulmonary edema in patients with severe COVID-19 are explained by multiple mechanisms, which includes a) endotheliitis as a result of direct viral injury and perivascular inflammation leading to microvascular and microthrombi deposition b) dysregulation of the RAAS due to increased binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptors and c)activation of the kallikrein- bradykinin pathway, the activation of which enhances vascular permeability, d)enhanced epithelial cell contraction causing swelling of cells and disturbance of intercellular junctions.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[46]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[47]</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[48]</a>&nbsp;Besides IL-6 and TNF-&alpha;, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) induces the release of pro-IL-1&beta;, which is cleaved into the active mature IL-1&beta; that mediates lung inflammation, until fibrosis<strong>.</strong><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[49]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on Extrapulmonary Organ Systems</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the respiratory system is the principal target for SARS-CoV-2 as described above, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous system. SARS-CoV-2&ndash;induced organ dysfunction, in general, is possibly explained by either one or a combination of the proposed mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity, ischemic injury caused by vasculitis, thrombosis, or thrombo-inflammation, immune dysregulation, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysregulation.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[50]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Cardiovascular system (CVS)</strong>: Although the exact mechanism of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is unknown, it is likely multifactorial.

Extraordinary efforts by clinical researchers worldwide during this pandemic have resulted in the development of novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at an unprecedented speed to contain this viral illness that has devastated communities worldwide. Vaccination triggers the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. As per the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard, more than 2.4 billion doses of vaccine doses have been administered as of 22 June 2021 with approximately 22% of the world&#39;s population receiving at least one dose of the vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BNT162b2 vaccine:</strong>&nbsp;Results of an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial reported that individuals 16 years of age or older receiving two-dose regimen the trial vaccine BNT162b2 (mRNA-based, BioNTech/Pfizer) when given 21 days apart conferred 95% protection against COVID-19 with a safety profile similar to other viral vaccines.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[137]</a>&nbsp;Based on the results of this vaccine efficacy trial, the FDA issued a EUA on December 11, 2020, granting the use of the BNT162b2 vaccine to prevent COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>mRNA-1273 vaccine</strong>: Results from another multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that individuals who were randomized to receive two doses of mRNA-1273<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(mRNA based, Moderna) vaccine given 28 days apart showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 illness and no safety concerns were noted besides transient local and systemic reactions.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[138]</a>&nbsp;Based on the results of this vaccine efficacy trial, the FDA issued a EUA on December 18, 2020, granting the use of the mRNA-1273 vaccine to prevent COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ad26.COV2.S vaccine</strong>: A third vaccine Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 received EUA by the FDA on February 27, 2021, based on the results of an international multicenter, randomized,placebo-controlled multicenter, phase 3 trial showed that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine conferred 73.1% efficacy in preventing COVID-19&nbsp;in adult participants who were randomized to receive the vaccine.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[139]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine:&nbsp;</strong>Interim analysis of an ongoing multicenter randomized control trial demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and clinical efficacy of 70.4% against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses and 64 % protection against COVID-19 after at least one standard dose.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[140]</a>&nbsp;The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine has been approved or granted emergency use authorization to prevent COVID-19 in many countries across the world but has not yet received a EUA or approval from the FDA for use in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NVX-CoV2373 vaccine:&nbsp;</strong>Preliminary results from a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in South Africa evaluating the&nbsp;efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373(Novavax) a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle genetically engineered vaccine reported that NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing COVID-19.<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/#\">[141]</a>&nbsp;This trial was conducted when the country was experiencing a second wave of infection due to the&nbsp;Beta(B.1.351)variant implying efficacy against this virus.
